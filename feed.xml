    The telephone rang once, stopped, then rang again.&nbsp;Daniel de Jager let it ring a third time before answering; the office line was not widely circulated and those who had it tended to use it sparingly.<br><br>“De Jager Antiques.” he said.<br><br>“Daniel,” Croker replied. His voice was clear and unhurried. “Good afternoon.”<br><br>“Afternoon, you caught me between . . . things.”<br><br>“I apologise,” Croker said. “Did you receive the email I sent this morning?”<br><br>“I saw it come in, I haven't opened it yet.”<br><br>“Would you mind doing so now?”<br><br>Daniel rolled his chair back from the desk and reached for the mouse. The computer took a moment to wake. Daniel opened it and scrolled.&nbsp;He read slowly through once, then again from the beginning. When he reached the end for the second time, he leaned back and rested his hand on the edge of the desk.<br><br>“It reads, at least in places, like a sermon,” he said. “Evangelical, but seems unusually technical. It definitely isn't written for a general audience.”<br><br>“No.” Croker said.<br><br>"What's the earliest scientific reference?"<br><br>"Nineteen sixty."<br><br>Daniel scrolled back up to the top of the screen and sighed before asking. “I assume there is a reason you are asking me to read it?”<br><br>“Yes . . . it was written in seventeen seventeen.” Croker said.<br><br>Daniel did not respond immediately but returned to the top of the screen and read the first paragraph again.<br><br>“That's not possible.” he said.<br><br>“We thought you might say that.”<br><br>“The vocabulary alone would be anachronistic, the whole thing assumes developments that didn't exist at the time.”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>Daniel closed the email window. “Where was it found?”<br><br>“Archivio Nove,” Croker said. “Deposited with a collection of handwritten sermons attributed to a group calling itself the Oxford Order. The documents have been sealed since eighteen forty eight. No access requests logged and with no unauthorised views.”<br><br>Daniel pictured the stacks, the hum of the air conditioning and the paper bound with ribbon.<br><br>“You are confident the document was present at the time of deposit?” he said.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“And unchanged?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>Daniel was silent.<br><br>“The Oxford Order is not defunct,” Croker said. “They are believed to still operate in some capacity out of Magdalen College. The network has linked them to ritual practice. Specifically, formalised door opening.”<br><br>Daniel exhaled through his nose. “Then there will be texts.”<br><br>“Likely.”<br><br>“Soooo . . . you want me to identify them?”<br><br>“We want you to determine what they are doing and whether the activity warrants intervention. Make of that what you will.”<br><br>Daniel looked at the shelves lining the office walls. Spines without titles and boxes marked only by date.<br><br>“I will need a little time.” he said.<br><br>“Of course.”<br><br>“When do you require an answer.”<br><br>“As soon as you are able.”<br><br>The line went dead.<br><br>Daniel remained seated for several seconds after the call ended. He then shut down the computer, locked the filing cabinet and put on his jacket; a khaki cagoule, worn thin at the cuffs. He pulled a baseball cap down low and stepped into the stairwell.&nbsp;Outside, Southall was alive with activity. Crates of fruit and rolls of fabric spilled colour onto the pavement, the sights and sounds of little India a necessary realignment after hours of sorting through invoices in the stuffy De Jager Antiques office.<br><br>He walked slowly toward Imperial Chef, his favourite lunchtime spot, soaking in the atmosphere as he pondered the email and its impossible content. He took his usual seat and ordered his usual meal; crab foo yung and Hong Kong style sweet and sour pork. The food arrived promptly. He ate as he watched people pass the window; the rhythm of the street and the hum of the bustle steadied his thoughts.<br><br>Yinuo, the proprietors daughter, was behind the counter as she usually was. Their eyes met briefly.&nbsp;She knew he kept secrets. He knew she knew. When he'd finished, they exchanged their usual nod before Daniel stepped back into the street. He adjusted his cap, lit a cigarette and turned toward the office.<br>

  <p>
    <i>Every human life is shaped by memory. Our choices, perceptions, and even our sense of time itself are the fruit of accumulated experience. Memory is a reflection of God’s own nature. Before the first light broke across the heavens, God not only spoke creation into being through the Word but also held within Himself the total memory of what was, what is, and what will be. This divine experiential memory is the foundation of moral authority. God commands not from ignorance or arbitrariness but from infinite knowledge; His own experiential memory.<br><br>Scripture begins not with explanation but with proclamation: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” Beneath those words lies a truth often overlooked, creation itself presupposes order and structure. The universe is not a random collection of events but a carefully described framework, sustained by the Word of God. We can measure the patterns of that framework, but cannot explain why such patterns exist. They are downstream from a deeper source, rooted in His infinite memory.<br><br>Mathematics and physics serve as explanations of existing form and function within our universe. However, neither explain why or how the rules behind those forms and functions exist in the first place. They merely express patterns and regularities in a system that is already rules-based. Were the universe not governed by consistent laws, repeated experiments would yield inconsistent outcomes. Modern philosophy of science confirms this: laws are not merely descriptive summaries but constraints that actively govern what is possible (Adlam).<br><br>This implies that the source of those rules, whatever gives rise to mathematical regularity, must itself be sophisticated. Just as faulty data produces faulty outcomes, the structure responsible for governing the universe must be coherent, purposeful, and precise. Physicists have likewise recognised this coherence. Steven Weinberg argues that the laws of nature are real features of reality, not human conventions, and their universality across scales reveals a profound order (Weinberg). Sean Carroll similarly insists that the laws underlying everyday physics are completely understood, highlighting that ordinary life itself unfolds on a rule-based framework (Carroll). At the most fundamental level, Juan Maldacena shows how symmetry principles shape physical law, demonstrating that regularities are not accidental but woven into the fabric of the cosmos (Maldacena).<br><br>No mathematical operator or concept can be fully understood apart from language: What is “1”? What is a “number”? What is “2” in relation to “1”? These concepts require not only symbols but also semantic attribution; they must be named and understood relationally through language. That mathematics so effectively describes physical reality has long been regarded as an “unreasonable effectiveness,” suggesting that the universe itself is structured in a way that is profoundly intelligible (Wigner).<br><br>This leads to a profound theological proposition: the phrase “the living Word of God” should be taken literally. The laws of the universe, the frameworks of form and function,&nbsp; were formulated through conscious thought and expressed through structured language. Each rule is built from operators that are not merely abstract but descriptively named and assigned meaning. This structure enables creation without requiring a prior state, rendering theories of spontaneous catalysis or impersonal emergence insufficient. Without an intelligent agent expressing the conditions for possibility, existence could not follow.<br><br>It would be meaningless for God to create within the bounds of the universe unless that creation could be sustained. The framework of physical law, then, is not a byproduct of creation, it is the foundation. Genesis 1:1, often overlooked in its depth, reveals the miracle: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.” This creation assumes a framework already capable of supporting such action; chemical law, vibration, gravity, quantum fields. It is this precondition that makes all subsequent activity in Genesis 1 possible.<br><br>This initial framework is itself a work of divine language, a self-sustaining structure expressed through descriptive command. It tells a story of intentionality and technical detail far removed from caricatures of God as a cosmic magician. The real miracle of Genesis lies not merely in the appearance of light, land, or life - but in the very architecture that made such things possible.<br><br>If the human hippocampus later appears as a biological organ for structuring experience through incoming stimuli, it is because it reflects God’s own perfect experiential memory, expressed through the language He is using. His moral authority is grounded in His total experiential knowledge; nothing escapes Him, and no outcome is hidden from His understanding. For this reason, His commandments are not arbitrary but rooted in the fullness of memory and meaning that only He possesses. To obey God, therefore, is to align with the only memory broad enough to define what is good.<br><br>In Job 38, the Lord confronts Job’s presumption in questioning Him without knowledge: “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Tell me, if you understand. Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!” God’s challenge is not cruelty but a reminder that true authority flows from perfect experiential memory, the source of all His knowledge. Unlike human beings, whose choices are shaped by limited recall and imperfect knowledge, God’s judgements rest on the total memory of creation itself. His moral law is not arbitrary command but the expression of knowledge that is absolute, unbounded, and eternal.<br><br>Just as God laid the foundations of the earth, He imprinted upon humanity a limited reflection of this capacity through the gift of memory. The hippocampus, a small yet extraordinary structure in the human brain, orders our experiences in time, allowing us to learn, to grow, and to choose. Our moral lives depend on this capacity, yet it is but a faint echo of God’s perfect memory. Where we recall dimly, He remembers fully. Where we struggle to order experience, He holds all creation in flawless sequence.</i>

  <p>
    Mrs. Rabastandratana’s squeaky wheels and excited whoops tempered the fear storm spreading around the hall. Making her way to the front of the crowd, she leaped from her chair to perform a spasmodic jig in front of Rosie and the beast before taking a bow. My father’s face was incredulous, though fear had gripped him enough to not intervene. “Let’s sing a song from the old country” she bellowed joyously. The piano, still intact, became the new focal point in the room as Mrs. Rabasandratana launched into a haunting, operatic vocal and slammed her hands on the keys, creating an unholy din. The sounds were unsettling, with some residents placing hands over their ears and prompting knee-bending in others. My own bowels felt loosened by the performance and I saw my father massage his throat. The possessed Rosie clapped when the show was over. The beast lowered its head, and she thudded to the floor. She and Mrs. Rabasandratana spoke animatedly in a foreign tongue.<br><br>As they conversed, Rosie glanced at the beast and pointed to the crowd. Without hesitation, the worm moved toward the residents. Broad darted left, my father, gripping my shirt collar, pulled us right and onto our backs. Many of the residents didn’t move and were knocked heavily in one direction or the other by the beast’s thrashing. A path had been cleared, leaving a crouched and semi-naked Gary with his back turned. <br><br>The creature reared with the sound of an idle motorcycle, its head flowering to reveal its primary weapons. Laying on our sides, my father and I watched as Gary stood from his crouched position, revealing an unconscious Simon, wearing his purple shirt. With Rosie distracted by Mrs. Rabasandratana, the creature froze momentarily before darting forward. Inches from Gary - its maw opened wide enough to take Simon whole. A few seconds later, it burst into black vapour. It was over.<br><br>With the last of the original summoning group dead, the bargain had been broken. A piercing shriek filled the hall before Rosie vomited a viscous black liquid all over herself. She appeared confused as she scanned the room, then looked down at her dress. <br><br>“I need a bath. I’m dirty. I need a bath.”<br><br>Before too long, police and ambulance crews were all over the grounds of Victoria House. I sat in the reading corner, detached, hearing everything as if it were experienced in a cave; the sound of police radios, heated conversation, and anxious yelps combined to create an echoey white noise. I was trying to convince myself that the story we were all telling was true but couldn’t reconcile events in my head, despite having witnessed it all. The stupor was interrupted by my father, whose furious-looking face told me not to argue with whatever he said next.<br><br>“We’re going home. Say goodbye to whoever and be quick about it, please.”<br><br>I stood and saw a room full of people who seemingly had no idea I’d even been there, such was the terror. Mrs. Rabasandratana and Gary were by the bottle-green door. I waved to them as my father and I walked toward the reception exit. Gary waved back. Mrs. Rabasandratana, fists aloft, raised a middle finger on each and thrust them forward and back repeatedly like a gunslinger. As the double doors to the reception swung shut I hugged my father. His gigantic hand gently rubbed the back of my head. <br><br>“Come on. Your mother’s waiting.”<br><br>As we drove home, I noticed the clock on the dash said 3.33 am. Hours had passed since the beast disappeared, and I had lived those hours in a haze - my mind clambered for answers. I had never been to church outside of the occasional school nativity. Its overbearing symbology filled me with guilt. I was self-aware, knowledgeable enough to know how to treat people, smart enough to avoid needless conflict. I didn’t think I needed a church to know the true human condition. After the events of that day, I knew further still what people will do for themselves at the expense of others. It was about all I understood at that time.<br><br>On the drive home, I thought of Dermot. With eyes closed, I prayed to God for peace in his spirit. I asked to see him again. For an opportunity to love him.<br><br>As I shifted position in the back seat, I could feel the firmness of the Summonitores Libro pressing against my back. Surprised it was there, I removed it from my trousers and ran my hand across its fabric cover. How could something this evil appear so innocent? I knew then that nothing would be over until the Summonitores Libro was destroyed. Staring at me in the rear-view mirror, my father noticed the book in my hands, slammed on the brakes and turned in his seat.<br><br>“What’s that in your hands?”<br><br>“Dad . . . we need to burn it,” I said.<br><br>He opened the glove box to reveal a bottle of whiskey.<br><br>Standing in a meadow, my father and I watched as the Summonitores Libro burned. Howls, grunts, and screaming emanated from the smoke. The suffering of those who had encountered its empty promises and all of its cruelty, emptied into the impossibly dark meadows of rural Surrey. There, in the fire, the pale white woman from its pages; the true face of the demon, briefly appeared sporting a wry smile. <br><br>The books had survived through selfish endeavour and human curiosity. I had seen a little of what lies beyond. The world hidden from human view harboured great secrets, with the words of the Summonitores Libro lubricating doorways to its darkest places. I realised with her smirk, there would be many more copies of the text. Many more trapped souls. Many would succumb to its promise.<br><br>Twenty five years have passed since these events. I have spent the best part of the last ten purchasing and destroying as many copies as I could.  I have written and recorded this testimony, sent my fathers recordings and notes as supporting evidence; I want to encourage a search of your archives. Please destroy any remaining copies of the Summonitores Libro. Thank you.

    The recording ended in silence. Monsignor Vescari removed his glasses and pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose. Outside, Rome’s bells tolled the Angelus. The air in the study felt charged, as if the words he had heard still lingered, unwilling to leave. On the desk, the CD spun its final rotation, eventually whispering to a stop.<br><br>He sat motionless for a time, the letter open before him, until decision overcame caution. Rising, he gathered the disc and the papers, tucked them beneath his arm, and made his way toward the Apostolic Library. As he got close, something stopped him in his tracks. He turned his head toward a group photo hanging on the wall. He’d seen it thousands of times by now but some faint memory drew him to the names of the people in the image, written on yellowing postcard at the bottom of the frame. Scanning the card, what drew him to the image so suddenly, met his eye. He looked at the corresponding photo. Front row, second from the left. His eyes darted back to the name. Sister Rabasandratana.<br><br>Vescari drew breath sharply, turned and made his way to the library, urgent now. As he entered, the hum of the air systems filled his ears. At the last checkpoint, two Swiss Guards stepped aside in silence. He unlocked the narrow iron door of Archivio IX, a vault sealed since the nineteenth century, and descended into its cool heart until he reached the catalogue shelf. There, his eyes found a handwritten entry in fading ink: <br><br>“Summonitores Libro. De origine ignota. Anno Domini 1884, Index 47B.”<br><br>He followed the reference into a narrow aisle. On the lowest shelf rested a small oak chest bound with red ribbon, its surface dulled by dust. Kneeling, he traced the Latin etched across the lid, “De Daemonibus et Invocatione.” He hesitated only a moment before breaking the seal.<br><br>Inside were four slim volumes, the leather dry and flaking.  For several seconds, he stared. Then he closed the chest, carried it to the furnace alcove adjoining the vault, and set it down. <br><br>He struck a match. The flame caught the dry wood instantly. Within moments, light spilled from the cracks of the oak, bright as molten metal. A low hum filled the chamber, rising to a vibration that shook the floor beneath his feet. From deep within the vault came a single shriek, thin and metallic, then another.&nbsp;Vescari stepped back as the chest erupted. Fire licked upward, alive with motion, consuming the volumes with impossible speed.<br>

    Rosie looked different. Strong and upright, the slight hunch and awkward gait was gone. Her carriage reminded me of an encyclopaedia illustration I once saw of Joan of Arc rallying troops; beckoning confrontation. Towering beside her, the worm stood in an S-shape, its cavernous mouth dripping fluids onto the parquet flooring. Its breathing was a slow, rhythmic pulsing. Ripples passed through its pale pink body, each ending in a rush of air that sounded like breath pushed through cold fingers on a winter morning.<br><br>I could feel my body preparing to flee. My vision narrowed. I could hear my heartbeat, then I wasn’t sure where I was at all. According to my father, I turned to him and asked if we were having toad-in-the-hole for dinner before collapsing.<br><br>In reality, Dermot had never been to my home. Most parents wouldn’t take on the responsibility, not even briefly. But the vividness of the image, him standing at our front door, convinced me for years it was a memory and not a dream. Our dining table was set for two. Torn wrapping paper littered the living room floor, a detail my mother later used to discredit the whole thing. “There’s no way I’d leave paper lying around with visitors coming,” she said, clearly disturbed. Her aversion to mess, germs and by extension, people, made it all the more implausible. Still, I would have preferred the false memory to the guilt I now know it really was.<br><br>Conversation with Dermot had never been possible. He lived trapped in his own mind, and everyone who knew him was dragged into his waking terror. In my dream, he spoke clearly, laughed, ate jelly, flew toys around the room. The realisation that none of it had happened came slowly, after the conversation with my mother. The joy and the playfulness were borrowed from memories with other people. Things I knew we should have shared with Dermot.<br><br>My father, ever the rugby forward, carried smelling salts. It used to make my mother and me laugh; watching him dash across the pitch to rouse a teammate, only to berate them seconds later for weak play. When I came to, his unimpressed face loomed over mine. He yanked me to my feet by the back of my shirt. I shook him off and moved toward the front of the crowd, flushed with embarrassment.<br><br>The scene hadn’t changed. I glanced at Broad’s watch: 8.45 p.m. My father had instructed everyone to remain in the hall. He worried movement might stir the creature. While it looked terrifying, it was motionless, seemingly awaiting a command from Rosie. For the first time in my life, I saw fear in my father’s eyes. Broad was sweating profusely. I saw him wring out his handkerchief onto the floor. Two men who had built their lives solving problems were now utterly lost and as vulnerable as everyone else. Their posture spoke total resignation.<br><br>A familiar hand landed on my shoulder. Gary was smiling.<br><br>“We’ve got a plan,” he whispered, and led me to the back of the hall. I edged through the crowd and reached a small group of residents, huddled and half-naked, beside a pile of discarded purple shirts. Gary still wore his.<br><br>Tasked with keeping spirits up, Gary had taken to his role with gusto. His understanding of the residents, their moods and their quirks, had been invaluable. “If we’re not wearing shirts, it won’t eat us,” he said. It couldn’t hurt, I thought, but doubted it would matter. What would the creature do if no one wore purple? Would it just pick at random?<br><br>It was a sacrificial plan. I urged Gary to take off his shirt. He refused. A wheel squeaked behind me. I felt a tug on my blazer. Mrs. Rabasandratana was whispering strange animal noises, motioning me closer with a curled finger. I leaned in. She grabbed my tie.<br><br>“Fucking stupid’a boy,” she grinned. “You have'a the book, little wank.”<br><br>She snatched the Summonitores Libro from my belt and flipped through the pages until muttering, “Bingo.” She held it up. There it was, the worm, ridden by the beautiful woman I'd seen on a separate page.<br><br>“I can’t read this,” I stammered. <br><br>She looked horrified. “Why you not know Latin? Are you fucking stupid’a?”<br><br>“No. What does it say?”<br><br>“I teach you. Fuckin idiota.” <br><br>Her method was brutal - not unlike my grandmother’s. I’d always struggled with languages, a source of shame in a family of bilinguals. My grandmother’s Dutch lessons were laced with shrieking and theatrical despair. More than once, I’d caught my father smirking in the background while she flailed her arms, shouting, “Is this boy fucking stupid?” Meanwhile, my sister collected china ornaments from an antique dealer in my Grandmothers home town of Groningen; rewards for fluent recitations.<br><br>“If I could stand up, I smack you up in your face,” snapped Mrs. Rabasandratana. She shaped her hands into a bird, flapped them gently, then transformed the gesture into two thrusting middle fingers.<br><br>“Let’s kick off’a the head and throw in a river of piss.”<br><br>I stared, lost in the insult’s surreal poetry.<br><br>“I don’t understand,” I said. “Please, what does it say?”<br><br>She sighed and proceeded to jerk into a different pose and dramatic expression with every point she made.<br><br>“Summon demon. It smile like friend. You make wish. Demon trap souls. Hide them from God. Is bad book. No?”<br><br>“What can we do?”<br><br>She leaned closer, her tone darkened.<br><br>“I listen to the teacher lady. Had a vision. Said book choose you. They fear you now. Think maybe if you go … demon go too. A trade. I think you have job little man.”<br><br>I didn't feel shocked by the statement. A small voice inside me stirred - not quite belief, but recognition. A seed had been planted - for what I couldn't be sure.<br><br>Mrs. Rabasandratana pulled Gary toward her and whispered something in his ear. Both giggling like school-children, I wondered how they could find anything to laugh about before heading over to my father. I looked at Broad’s watch: 9.19 pm.  The room began to smell strongly of urine. Every strained yelp from a resident was followed by another and then another. My father and Broad remained stationary at the head of the increasingly anxious crowd, attempting to maintain authority despite knowing that when the beast moved to strike, there would have been nothing they could do; likely praying that the creature knew to target those wearing purple. I had wondered myself whether the presence of outsiders might prompt Rosie to eliminate them both, or anyone who might compromise the integrity of the bargain. Then again, who would believe any of it had ever happened?

  <p>
    At 4 p.m., sandwiches distributed, I found myself staring out of the windows again. An old-fashioned lamp on the driveway had come on, likely on a timer to light the way on short winter days. Rain fell with impossible ferocity, though the windows remained free of droplets. Bushes were dragged in every direction across the shingle, pulling small stones and dried leaves from the ground which became briefly airborne, giving the uprooted flora the form of a living creature. I couldn’t work out if any of it was even happening.<br><br>I saw Mr Column’s car moving up the shingle path, this time accompanied by a fire truck and a police car a short distance behind. Relieved, I waved excitedly at them. I was surprised to see my father get out of the police vehicle along with D.I. Broad. I promptly put my hands by my side. I wanted him to see that I had coped well in this unusual situation and I certainly didn’t want to provide him with additional storytelling material. Once they had all emerged from their vehicles, they briefly huddled as a group before D.I. Broad went to the back of the police car, opened the door, and roughly led Simon, now handcuffed, to the attention of the huddle. Mrs Tapscott appeared beside me, gave a tut and said, “Simon, you fool.”<br><br>Mr Column began walking toward the window. When he got within a few feet, his gaze shifted upward, and he slowly retreated. Suddenly, Gary’s voice pierced the air with a sharp exclamation. “Worm!” Startled, I turned to see him pointing urgently out of the window. I jerked my head around to see Mr Column running toward his car and something large slithering at speed toward him across the shingle.<br><br>The creature reached Mr Column in no time, emitting a sound reminiscent of an idling motorcycle as it reared up, its head blooming into a flower, petalled with teeth and with a central hollow to draw flesh into its abyssal innards. For a brief second, the beast paused, pulsing. Then it jerked forward and back. Mr Column had instinctively raised his arms, which were now missing hands. His bloodied stumps swiped at the air where his head used to be.<br><br>My father and D.I. Broad reacted immediately, dragging Simon into the back of the police car. The creature turned to one of the firefighters, shoving its head between his legs and launching him into the air. He vanished into the storm-tossed sky for several seconds before crashing down on the hood of the police car. As he made impact, the creature slammed its head onto his chest, flipping the car in a full, brutal 360-degree arc.<br><br>The remaining firefighter, armed with a high-pressure hose, fired directly at the worm. The blast staggered it. The creature coiled and then balled up, retreating quickly out of view.<br><br>My father, Broad, and Simon, now uncuffed, clambered from the wrecked vehicle and into the cabin of the fire truck. With a blast of acceleration, the truck hurtled down the shingle path, weaved through the trees in the adjacent field, and doubled back, straight for Victoria House. I knew they were going to smash through the building.<br><br>I shouted at the residents to stand up and run to the back of the hall; most did as instructed, though a few remained frozen with their hands on their cheeks, bobbing up and down with slightly bent knees. I shouted again, more forcefully, pushing two of them into motion before making my own way to the back of the hall. I glanced around to check for stragglers.<br><br>Mrs Tapscott hadn’t moved from the reading corner.<br><br>She turned to Rosie, who was sitting calmly nearby, and said, “Please let me go.” Her voice was low and tired, more like someone surrendering than pleading. For a second, Rosie blinked, as if registering the words, but said nothing. Then, without warning, Mrs. Tapscott was hurled several feet to the side by something unseen, her toes dragged across the floor before she landed hard and didn’t move.<br><br>The fire truck smashed through the windows, its tyres dragging Mrs Tapscott beneath the wheels. Wood, brick, and glass erupted into the hall, spraying in a deadly arc. Collective screams and yelps from the residents drowned out most of the impact.<br><br>Dust hung thick in the air, whisked by the cool breeze blowing through the shattered facade. The truck had come to a rest, only halfway inside.<br><br>The driver’s door opened, and a body slumped out - one of the firefighters, shards of glass embedded in his face and neck. My father thudded beside him onto the floor, somehow still looking composed, like a man arriving home after a long day’s work. D.I. Broad emerged next, blood gushing from a gash across his forehead. As he dabbed at it with a handkerchief, I noticed his little finger was bent at a right angle. Simon emerged last, mostly unscathed apart from a small cut above his right brow.<br><br>My father staggered around the truck and grabbed Simon by the throat with one huge hand.<br><br>“You failed to mention when questioned there was a massive fucking snake that rips people’s heads off!”<br><br>He continued to berate Simon while I got down on my hands and knees and crawled toward where Mrs Tapscott had been. I caught a glimpse of her beneath the vehicle and quickly wished I hadn’t. A single broken shoe lay beside her. A pair of cracked spectacles rested in a pool of her blood.<br><br>My father walked away from the truck toward the back of the hall. I sidestepped for a better view and saw him partially silhouetted, swaying left and right. Adjusting my position, I could see that some large glass fragments remained intact around the edges of the wooden frames of the window. Through them, the storm continued to rage outside whilst the last of the setting sun shone through where glass had previously been. I couldn't see any clouds. I couldn't see uprooted bushes.<br><br>My father bent down to pick up a shard resting by his foot and held it in his palms. I did the same - and stood transfixed by the unholy mirage playing out on its surface. A comforting pat on the shoulder came from Gary. I turned to look at him.<br><br>“Magic,” he said simply.<br><br>The illusion was meant to keep us inside the building.<br><br>Gary spent some time explaining what he had recently seen. Although disordered, overlapping, and impossible to build a reliable timeline from, his stories were heard intently by my father and D.I. Broad and accepted as truth. While not always used for peaceful effect, Gary had a gift for rallying the other residents. Many came forward to corroborate fragments of his story, some simply calling out, “I saw that,” and others filling in overlooked details. D.I. Broad had been writing at pace in his notebook before his Biro pen ran out of ink. It was then that they turned their attention to Simon, who was sitting cross-legged by the bottle green door, alone.<br><br>D.I. Broad sat himself down next to Simon, while my father remained standing, looking down. He pulled a Dictaphone from his inside jacket pocket. Broad jerked forward, grabbing the back of Simon’s head and pressing his thumb hard into the fresh wound on Simon’s brow. Simon yelped sharply, loud enough to get the attention of the room.<br><br>“Just so you know we’re not fucking about,” the detective barked, gritting his teeth. “One word of a lie and we’ll throw you outside to that fucking... thing.”<br><br>“Explain the snake. What is the snake? Or worm, or whatever,” my father added. Simon’s eyes showed more fear with my father bearing down on him than when the creature had appeared. Without further prompting, he answered quietly, “It came from a book.”<br><br>“What? What fucking book?” Broad demanded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simon took a short breath and explained. “A small group of staff had been celebrating the charity’s 150th year. As the celebration wound down, Mrs Tapscott, a trustee of the charity and a Latin speaker, began reading from a strange book they found in the reading corner. A cloud appeared in the centre of the room, rolling around the hall before disappearing into the dormitories. A few minutes later, the cloud reappeared - this time speaking through one of the residents.”<br><br>“Why didn’t you mention this when you came to see us this afternoon? You told us you thought another resident had killed the missing girl.” Broad said sharply.<br><br>“Oh, come on, you would have had me sectioned. I just needed to get you here . . . to see for yourself,” Simon blurted.<br><br>“Okay, so what happened to the missing girl?”<br><br>Simon paused, swallowed hard, then said quietly, “We fed her to the demon.”<br><br>“Demon? You mean the snake?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“No? So there’s a demon and a snake?”<br><br>“The demon controls the creature. It eats people. It collects consciousness.”<br><br>“It collects what? What are you on about?” Broad sneered.<br><br>“I'm not sure . . . Tapscott understood it better.”<br><br>“How many people has it killed?”<br><br>“One a month for the last eighteen months.”<br><br>“So what, this thing just emerges and takes someone? Our friend Gary over there seems to think you bring it the food,” my father said.<br><br>“We brought it here. It bargained with us. We came up with a system. If the residents act up, they get a purple shirt. The demon selects from those wearing them at 9:23 pm on the 21st of every month, the time and day we summoned it,” Simon responded.<br><br>“So why is it attacking us?”<br><br>“I imagine you’re a threat to its supply. Can't be sure.”<br><br>“What happens if you don’t provide anyone?”<br><br>“Six of us were present that evening . . . only me left now.”<br><br>“Ah. So you’ll be in trouble?”<br><br>“Four wouldn’t participate or put the experience down to there being too much alcohol that night. They were taken first. There are a handful of other volunteers who weren’t present that night - day staff. They don’t know what’s happening.”<br><br>Broad scoffed, incredulous. “Bollocks. If four people vanished from the same place, the world would know. Not to mention the residents.”<br><br>“They were all volunteers from another program run by the charity. All foreign nationals. Orderlies,” Simon corrected.<br><br>“How have you hidden the rest? Haven’t relatives been asking questions?” Broad snapped.<br><br>“Families don’t bother once the problem is no longer theirs to deal with. Many of the residents have health problems, and we have a crematorium on the grounds.” I saw my father’s anger building. He rubbed his thumbs against his index fingers, a sign he was close to exploding.<br><br>“So nobody was going to miss a bunch of spackers, right? Except Gilly’s family cared very much, didn’t they?”<br><br>“Gilly was a mistake. The shirt was meant for someone else. Some of the residents - I can’t tell them apart.”<br><br>Broad shook his head with disgust, clearly shocked by Simon’s statement. He stood up and made a brazen suggestion that surprised even my father, who looked at him disparagingly<a href="https://dejageruniverse.digital/the-trouble-with-tongues/" rel="nofollow noopener">.</a> “I think I’d very much like to talk to this demon. Ask it here, would you?”<br><br>“It’s the 21st . . . she’s already here.” Simon shifted his torso to look past my father’s legs. Everybody listening, including myself, followed his gaze over to the reading corner. Rosie was still there. Watching us.

  <p>
    I sharply pulled my hand from the pages. I couldn't be sure what I'd seen or how I had seen it. I had travelled between consciousnesses, seeing through the eyes of people I had never met and at a time I could never have present. Curiosity got the better of me and was about to place my hand down on the page again before I heard a door swing. I watched Mrs. Tapscott stride across the room to the bottle green door. As she went through, I noticed Mrs. Rabasandratana had joined me in the room. She glared at me for several minutes. As much as I tried to avoid looking directly at her, I couldn’t for fear of losing track of her. The mental stimulus had already come thick and fast, and I felt close to a meltdown before a series of much shorter vignettes of my imminent death began playing in my mind.<br><br>I closed the book, tucked it into my trousers, and struck up the courage to ask if she was okay. Mrs. Rabasandratana stood from her wheelchair and began a painfully slow walk toward me. I could hear her muttering something in a foreign language. I asked again if she was okay before her slow walk turned into a full-on sprint. I gripped the arms of the chair as the muttering became full-on screeching.<br><br>I peeled back and closed my eyes, realising I had delayed too long to get out of the chair and flee. Her hands were on top of mine, holding them down. I opened my eyes to find her smiling at me.<br><br>“You seen something, boy? Listen . . .&nbsp; listen . . . listen. Stupid’a teacher lady, no good. You’re gonna be dinner.”<br><br>She released my hands, then, looking like an old woman again, hobbled back to her wheelchair. I was fast becoming a wreck. Mrs. Tapscott, much to my relief, came through the green door and propped it open with a chair. The residents of Victoria House came pouring into the hall.<br><br>Mrs. Tapscott, who at that point showed no signs of panic, explained to me that the doors and windows were locked and the phones disconnected. The members of staff who had been present in the morning had all abandoned the property, leaving Mrs. Tapscott and myself in control of seventy people in varying degrees of distress, each dealing with either a physical or intellectual disability. She smiled softly and said that I needed to show maturity, and asked if I made sandwiches at home.<br><br>My mother was paranoid I would burn the house to the ground and so never allowed me anywhere near the kitchen, but a sandwich? Two slices of bread with something spread inside seemed well within my ability. So I simply said, “Yes.”<br><br>Rosie volunteered to help me prepare, and we were led toward the bottle green door. On our way through, Rosie asked the piano-slamming man in the purple shirt if he was okay. Eyes closed and arms folded, he remained silent.<br><br>I challenged Rosie to a culinary duel. Whoever could make the most sandwiches in the shortest amount of time would win the Mars bar we found in the fridge. Powering ahead, I noticed that she was much more concerned with creating a delicious sandwich than she was with speed - rolling her tongue around her lips in near-unbreakable concentration. I looked at my growing pile of scraggly sarnies and decided that Rosie had the right idea.<br><br>We chose three different fillings to try and cater to every resident. I chose strawberry jam. Rosie chose peanut butter with chocolate spread, and her favourite: grated cheese with a chutney preserve. When we were almost done and our silver platters were piled high, I took the opportunity to question Rosie. She left me hanging on every question until she had meticulously spread and sprinkled the next layer to the very edge of the bread. She wasn’t going to answer until she was good and ready.<br><br>The missing girl had been planting flowers by a collection of beds close to Rosie, who was doing the same, when the bearded man came to give Gilly a purple shirt. She mentioned that the bearded man, named Simon, had led Gilly away into Victoria House. Then came second-hand testimony about Gary, the purple-shirt man sat in the hall, who had witnessed a worm, or the long monster, emerge from the ground in the main hall and eat the girl.<br><br>When asked why residents were wearing purple shirts and why they couldn’t be spoken to, Rosie suggested that they had been naughty at various points during the day. I told myself the police could make sense of it, and that I would have to report it to my father as soon as I arrived home. I said to Rosie that we could stop making sandwiches and offered her the Mars bar. As I handed it over, I saw she had made an impressive Star of David with her central pile of sandwiches.<br><br>As we re-entered the main hall, I noticed the residents had been separated into two groups. The ones on the right side of the hall were facing away from the windows, while the ones on the left, all wearing purple shirts, were facing toward them.<br><br>Perhaps oddly, Mrs. Tapscott said that those wearing purple could eat, but only after the others had already finished. I wondered why she would be enforcing the unnecessary punishments of Simon, confirming in my mind an established link between my teacher and the staff of Victoria House that went beyond arranging the occasional field trip to teach big-mouthed kids a lesson.<br><br>I kept my eye on her as Rosie and I, armed with sandwiches, walked the lines between the pensive - looking residents. Behaviourally, they were in stark contrast to the residents in purple shirts, who repeatedly asked to re-attire, claimed to need the toilet despite numerous visits, and overall displayed signs of high anxiety.<br><br>With every request one of them made, others would raise their hands and ask exactly the same thing, like a word plague spreading throughout the group in near synchronous waves. Seemingly, they were desperate to extricate themselves from whatever situation they had perceived themselves to be in.<br><br>I surmised that Gary had worked the group up with talk of long monsters. He was with the purple-shirt group of residents, though unlike the others, said nothing and stared through the windows of the hall.

    Mr. Column stood beneath a suspended plant pot, positioned atop the window outside, seemingly impervious to the heavy rain that cascaded around him. Neither his scraggly shoulder-length hair nor his coat were blowing with the wind. By this point, the rain was so heavy that large pools of water had formed in dips in the shingle where cars had driven through. I could see rainwater dropping onto his shoulders as it spilled from the pot, but there appeared to be no impact splash. He stared back and shrugged, as if to suggest I should be doing something I wasn’t. Then he pointed toward the entrance, pushed his index finger against his thumb, and made a turning motion with them.<br><br>I promptly informed Mrs. Tapscott of Mr. Column's arrival and the issue with entry. Perplexed, she ventured through the double doors to the offices and reception area. Turning back, I saw Mr. Column strolling calmly to my left. Racing after Mrs. Tapscott, I joined her through the double doors to find her conversing with Mr. Column through a letterbox. A beam of sunlight pierced the darkness of the windowless entrance hall. A tingling sensation crawled across my skin.<br><br>As Mrs. Tapscott searched for light switches, Mr. Column held open the letterbox, allowing sunlight to filter in. Peering through, I could see nothing but darkness outside, despite the illumination on our side of the door. Thunder rumbled, and heavy rain continued, but Mr. Column insisted he was bathed in winter sun, even stating in bad taste that the residents' behaviours were rubbing off.<br><br>After a thorough exploration of every accessible office from the reception, Mrs. Tapscott ascended a flight of stairs, instructing me to wait in the main hall. Mr. Column decided to retreat to his car. Following orders, I settled into the reading corner of the main hall, hoping that immersing myself in a book would ward off the feeling of impending doom and swiftly pass the time until the return of the bearded man.<br><br>I had been carrying Summonitores Libro in the back of my trousers, hidden under my school blazer. Having flicked through the first three pages, my interest had been instantly piqued by the bizarre images and I decided it was worth the risk - and the wrath of my father - to sneak it out of Victoria House and get it home. I had time to have a closer look and digest some of its content. Much to my annoyance, the book was written in a foreign language.<br><br>I examined the images, most of them animals reminiscent of the kind in Dungeons and Dragons. Along with beasts from known fantasy lore, like fairies and the manticore, were demons, horned clouds, and wisps riding bulls and warthogs. The images were illustrated beautifully in black ink, the vision of each monster realised with a shading style that made them bulge from the pages. One in particular caught my attention: a strikingly beautiful woman, dark tattoos covering her bare chest and donning a crown with horns. Her body invited lust. Her eyes dared me into a touch. I ran my fingers across the image and was taken away.

  <p>
    London was under siege. Its people were stooped - eyes firmly on the stone bricks, lifting their heads only to gauge the next ten steps. There was no danger of bumping into one another. They dared not touch. Most did not leave their homes.<br><br>The Black Death could not sympathise with the repercussions of its presence - it knew nothing of clemency. It thrived in the weakened human spirit, the pessimism working as fuel in the body for its abduction of it. The plague had killed many. Starvation and isolation - many more.<br><br>The wealthy steered clear of the accumulated filth in the neighbouring streets, relying on their stores and city gardens for sustenance. Many of them greeted one another as they always had, with warm smiles and open arms. The merchant Otto, a follower of Christ, offered daily prayers for the sick.<br><br>Oliver, a tanner’s assistant, was afflicted. With opaque failing eyes, he forced himself up from his position under Otto’s kitchen window and staggered toward the market square, feeling along the familiar stone of houses and shops. There, representatives of the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity tended to swaths of infected people under a silk tent. Writhing and groaning with delirium, the keening echoing through the narrow streets and the walkways of the canals, vocalising the eerie morning mist as if it were a disgruntled apparition.<br><br>As the tanner arrived at an oak desk at the tent entrance, he crumpled into his own footprint. The attendant shouted for his colleagues, muffled by two inches of knitted scarf wrapped around his mouth and nose. A beaked plague doctor parted the tent curtains with two fingers to observe, then blew on a short wooden flute.<br><br>Otto the merchant had planted a seed of hatred in the tanner. Lying on a narrow plinth, surrounded by beaked figures in black garments, the tanner became vociferous in his contempt.<br><br>“He did not feed me. He did not quench my thirst. He did not offer me warmth. Is love not an action? Is an eternal inheritance not worthy of an intercession?”<br><br>The plague doctor Ruben had observed the tanner’s slumped body at the merchant’s window on his way to the tent every morning, for a full month. He stayed by Oliver’s side until sunset and caught the tanner’s last gasp before reaching into his pocket for a stocky and tightly rolled scroll. He whispered a secret from its passages into the howling gale at the tent entrance, then returned to his duties.<br><br>Otto, complacent, had considered his spirit secure with God, though an angel was perturbed by the merchant’s lack of action.<br><br>“I see his clean water, full store cupboards, and personal physician. Why does this man have compulsions to pray for assistance from God when he knows perfectly well the tools to restore the tanner are stocked in his pantry? He feeds and waters his goat, but has nothing spare for this man? The blessings bestowed upon him were for untested service. Now that he is in conflict with the Black Death, should those blessings be hoarded? To God, this is murder of the spirit. He will not help him. God will let the demon have its mischief.”<br><br>Otto could not hear the angel. His heart was firmly hardened, aligned with fleshy fear. He continued to pray for the sick, quietly and ineffectually. Full of misplaced confidence in his place with God, he returned from church with a skip in his step. As he entered his home, the merchant tilted his head to better hear the singing of local children and was filled with terror.<br><br>“<em>London is in trouble with the Lord, its people wear His wounds, the poor were first, their wounds did burst, now the merchant has it too.</em>”<br><br>Otto rushed through his door; its slam coincided with sudden darkness. With arms outstretched, he staggered blindly through an atmosphere thick with unease. A stream of light appeared before him, revealing the deceased tanner on a bed of quivering moss. Feeling an itch on his hand, the merchant raised it to the light and saw a boil-like swell. He screamed for an explanation from God, then for His help. Over the drone of flies, the merchant once again heard the singing of children:<br><br>“<em>For the merchant in his bubble, kept the lifeblood in his stores, and as London cried for help, the merchant kept it all. A wheel of cheese for the tanner. A wheel of cheese for the tanner.</em>”

    Rosie showed no interest in the story, and despite thirty minutes of persistence, her agitation was palpable. Mrs. Tapscott kept asking what was wrong, and each time, Rosie glanced at the bearded man, almost as if seeking permission to speak. She’d adjust her sitting position and temporarily stop scanning the room. This pattern repeated itself. I noticed Mrs. Tapscott shooting disapproving looks at the man, who remained absorbed in Rosie. The encounter was unsettling, as if all three were waiting on some unspoken action that never came. Eventually, realising the futility of continuing to read, the bearded man stood and announced there had been enough excitement for the morning. He led Rosie away, crossing the hall and disappearing through a bottle green door.<br><br>I returned The Hobbit to the shelf when a worn book, perched atop a row of leather-bound encyclopaedias, caught my eye. The book, titled Summonitores Libro, looked ancient, its thick, yellowed pages loose and fluttering to the floor as I opened it. As I bent down to gather them, Mrs. Tapscott suggested we meet some of the other residents. I tucked the book into the back of my trousers as we walked toward the bottle green door.<br><br>Before we reached it, a man accompanied by a uniformed police officer entered the hall. The bearded man, lost in thought, flung the door open just as we were about to pass through, nearly knocking Mrs. Tapscott off balance. He paid us no attention and made a direct line for the suited man.<br><br>I overheard the man introduce himself as Detective Inspector Broad. The female officer with him glanced our way, tilting her head in acknowledgement before walking over. She called me by name, explaining that my father, Arnold, had shown her a photograph of me and my sister on holiday in Great Yarmouth. To my surprise, she said my mother used to babysit her as a child.<br><br>The mood shifted quickly; I was suddenly under scrutiny for why I was at Victoria House. Mrs. Tapscott stepped in, subtly guiding the officer away to talk in private.<br><br>I had been wondering the same thing. What was I doing there? Why me and not Ben? Mrs. Tapscott knew me well and couldn’t possibly have believed I said those things. And my father showing photographs? He could barely stand to be in the same house as me, let alone show pride. The sentimentality didn’t add up.<br><br>I tried to eavesdrop on the bearded man and D.I. Broad. From what I caught, a resident was missing. Something about needing a statement. Voices were raised. The bearded man looked pale. Broad, though slim, was sweating heavily, dabbing his brow with a beige handkerchief.<br><br>As the bearded man left through the main entrance, the officer broke from Mrs. Tapscott and returned to D.I. Broad. They whispered behind cupped hands. Broad looked over and took a few steps toward me.<br><br>“Keep your eyes peeled, son,” he said, already turning away.<br><br>As they headed to the exit, the man in the purple shirt shouted, “He fed Gilly to a worm.” Both officers turned, trying to spot the speaker. They exchanged a confused look, then left.<br><br>I walked over to the windows. Outside, the officers stood beside an unmarked black car. In the back seat, I spotted a large figure. Smoke poured from the driver’s door as someone exhaled through a cigarette. As Broad entered the car, I stared at the man in the back. He looked familiar. All my father’s colleagues were big men, seemingly a prerequisite for 1970s police recruitment. As the car pulled away, my stomach dropped.<br><br>After lunch, Mrs. Tapscott announced that our field trip was being cut short. She arranged for Mr. Column to return. From the hall windows, I saw dark clouds building, darker than I’d seen since the 1987 hurricane. They didn’t look real, more like they’d been painted onto the sky. They rushed toward Victoria House with a howling gale that sent pot plants flying and bent the bushes and newly planted trees in the surrounding fields. Within minutes, the light dimmed. It felt like dusk.<br><br>The thunder began to roll - deep and constant, like drums in the distance. I imagined an army descending on horseback. Then the rain came, so heavy I could barely see past the shingle driveway. I wasn’t sure it was wise for Mr. Column to be driving in this, and I certainly didn’t want to be in a car during a storm. My mind spiralled into grim scenarios about the drive home. More than a few involved vomit.<br><br>My father often told me - usually while reviewing my schoolwork - that if something sounds or looks important, it probably is. His rule, born of twenty years in the police, was simple: write everything down. And if you can’t, repeat it until you can recite it backward. I could feel his influence and for a moment I could feel his hands on my shoulders. It felt like pressure to speak up. I needed to understand what I was doing there.<br><br>My gaze left the chaos outside and swept the hall. Mrs. Tapscott stood beside the bearded man, who was now wearing a coat. I heard him say, “I’ll be back soon,” before stepping out the door. <br><br>I had questions. But I didn’t know how to ask them in a way that would get answers. I wasn’t exactly a talker. I ran through my observations. One. Aside from the bearded man, I’d counted only four staff members during introductions. That seemed too few for seventy residents. It wasn’t surprising someone had gone missing. Two. Mrs. Tapscott seemed to know the bearded man well - too well. That needed explaining. Three. The man in the purple shirt was still in the same chair, arms folded. Two hours had passed. Despite his calm, that felt cruel. Four. The information booklet said people with Down Syndrome frustrate easily. Yet here he sat, motionless, patient. I’d have lost my mind. Five. Where were the other residents? I’d only seen a few in the hall. Of the seventy, not one had come in from the flower beds. No one had returned to the building.<br><br>I was about to walk over to Mrs. Tapscott when I heard a tap at the window. It was Mr. Column. Maybe none of my questions would need answering after all, I thought.

    We were somewhere in rural Surrey. A thick morning mist made visibility poor, and there were several stops to allow deer crossing the road a safe path into the adjacent meadows. Mr. Column, the school caretaker, was driving, with Mrs. Tapscott in the front passenger seat. My father had warned of the potential for travel sickness, giving a detailed description at the school gate of the time I projectile vomited onto the back of his head as we drove toward our static caravan in Great Yarmouth. Before too long, I could feel my stomach churning.<br><br>Every now and then, Mrs. Tapscott would turn her head around, smile, and ask if I was doing alright. I nodded, afraid that opening my mouth might encourage a now liquefied breakfast onto the back of Mr. Column’s head. In reality, I only ever vomited once in a car. My father’s reaction and tall storytelling had filled me with anxiety. On every subsequent journey, my imagination worked overtime to convince me there would be an outrageous regurgitation event. I then imagined puking so violently that my face burst with the pressure and my organs were ejected all over the windscreen, sending us skidding off the road to our deaths. I needed the journey to be over.<br><br>We turned off the main road onto a shingle path. There were lightly wooded fields on either side. I became distracted from my thoughts by the people tending to flowerbeds. Many were joyful, raising their hands and clapping. Some just stood staring at others working. One man was very close to the car on the side I sat, and I turned my head to look as we passed. His eyes seemed too small for his face and his jaw was large, giving him a grimace. Correcting my posture, I began to look closer at others as we slowly rolled by. Most of them had a similar appearance. I looked forward and caught Mrs. Tapscott watching me in the rear-view mirror. There was no smile this time. I had no idea what was happening but remember feeling dread, despite the effervescent vocables that could be heard all around me.<br><br>The car began to turn with the path, and a grand house, partially covered in red creepers, came into view. The car stopped, with Mrs. Tapscott exiting without a word to either me or Mr. Column. She disappeared into the open half of a thick wooden double door and returned seconds later pushing an old lady in a wheelchair. She waved me out of the car and as I approached asked me to introduce myself to Mrs. Rabasandratana.<br><br>Dad warned me about people that looked like the old lady, claiming I needed to stay away from them or I’d end up being turned into a toad. He called them Gypsies. Her face was pursed and looked like my grandad did when he removed his false teeth. Her jet black hair was visible through an untidily fitted headscarf, and her dress was navy blue with white dots. I remember her bare feet looked remarkably young, with pristine toenails painted pink and entirely absent were the thick green lines visible on my own grandmother’s feet. I sheepishly said hello before Mrs. Rabasandratana took my hand and shook it gently, speaking words in a language I didn’t understand. I was asked to roll her back into the building but didn’t quite have the strength to push the wheels through the shingle. Mrs. Tapscott was about to take over when Mrs. Rabasandratana stood up and skipped inside. I had no idea what to make of it but instinctively looked behind me for the exit. Mr. Column had already gone.<br><br>I was led room by room around the enormous estate and read sections of an information booklet between introductions. Victoria House was built and owned by a Rhodesian silversmith, named in honour of the Queen at the time of its completion. When the grandson of the builder died, he left it in trust to the charity he founded, also called Victoria House. At the time of my visit, it housed 70 people with developmental and learning disabilities. I discovered that the strange-looking folk I saw outside had Down Syndrome.<br><br>Upon reaching the halls of residence, I found myself ushered into a small room by a tall, bearded man. He handed me a list of rules on laminated paper, insisting that I could only enter the halls once I could successfully recite them from memory. As I scanned through the regulations, one particular rule etched itself into my mind - the last on the list and the sole instruction I remember word for word: Do not engage in conversation with residents wearing purple shirts. The peculiar specificity of this directive left me both intrigued and perplexed, raising questions about the reasoning behind such a seemingly arbitrary restriction. This distraction caused several failed attempts to recite the list in full.<br><br>Eventually, I was led into a large hall with zigzagged parquet flooring and three very tall windows with semi-circle Celtic wooden toppers at the far end of the room. A very old piano sat centrally, and a man with a stepladder was working above it, fiddling with wires in the ceiling. Dust was falling onto the top of the piano and glistened on its descent as the sun broke through the clouds and flooded into the hall. A large peacock-coloured tortoiseshell light shade rested on the floor nearby.<br><br>I had never seen a place like this before. It seemed as if more money had been invested in the soft furnishings than in the entirety of my parents’ house. Mrs. Tapscott walked me over to the windows, and I couldn’t resist touching the curtains that adorned them. The luxurious fabric felt otherworldly under my fingers. Here, I was introduced to Rosie, a middle-aged woman with Down Syndrome, donned in a pink dress with a large sunflower bow clipped to her straight shoulder-length brown hair. Observing me touching the curtain, she promptly began running her hands along them, eventually backing into one and wrapping herself inside. Cocooned within the lavish fabric, I could see her bending her knees up and down. The opulence of Victoria House was not lost on Rosie. She giggled until her laughter escalated into total rapture, prompting a staff member to be summoned to calm her down.<br><br>Her laughing was music to me, and I was caught smiling from ear to ear by Mrs. Tapscott. I was told that I’d be reading to Rosie and that I should pick a book from the reading corner and take a seat. As I strolled across, a group of six residents made their way into the centre of the room and began to ask questions of the electrician. He seemed completely at ease with them, made his way down the ladder, and sat at the piano. The room was then filled with music I recognised.<br><br>Despite my mother’s neurosis, she had always been liberal with the arts and what I was allowed to see as a child. We were both big horror fans and together would consume works by auteurs of the macabre in print and on celluloid. Despite never fully understanding context, by age eight, I had read every Clive Barker novel and short story, regularly rifling through my mother’s book collection for the nastiest looking cover I could find. When it wasn’t all about the horror, it was all about Doctor Who. Mother insisted the best Doctor was Patrick Troughton, whom I recognised as the priest from The Omen and so had decided the same. The electrician was playing the Doctor Who opening theme with gusto.<br><br>After a few minutes observing the scene, the body language of the residents was beginning to change, and I could sense something brewing. They were swaying from side to side in anticipation. The electrician seemed none the wiser, said something I couldn’t make out, and got up from the stool. One resident walked slowly toward the electrician and slammed his hand onto the top of the piano. After a few awkward seconds, he shouted, “Play… it… again.” The others shared glances, then began to support his demand with shouts of “Yeah!” and “Play!”<br><br>I couldn’t see the electrician’s face but could see he had a defensive posture, raising his hands, palms facing forward. Before any further escalation, the tall bearded man appeared again and led the antagonist away. With that, the others dispersed and made their way separately through various doorways. I retrieved a copy of The Hobbit, sat on one of the chairs, and waited for Rosie. Now that she was completely calm, Mrs. Tapscott brought her over accompanied by the bearded man. Behind him, I could see the piano-slamming man sitting on a chair, arms folded, wearing a purple shirt.

    The Prefect of the Vatican Apostolic Archives, Monsignor Aurelio Vescari, adjusted his spectacles as he examined the padded envelope that had arrived without insignia or return address. The handwriting was English, neat and deliberate. Inside were a folded letter, a stack of photocopied police documents, and a compact disc in a cracked plastic case. Across its surface, written in black marker, were the words: “Summonitores Libro - testimony of Daniel de Jager.”<br><br>He sat at his desk beneath the frescoed ceiling of the Archivum Secretum, the morning light reduced to a trembling line across his papers. For a long moment, he stared at the CD. Few things arrived unrecorded in the catalogue, and fewer still were accompanied by warnings.&nbsp;The letter bore a crest once used by the Diocese of Southwark. It began formally, but its tone broke down by the second paragraph, each line more frantic, eventually pleading for the destruction of a book. The writer claimed to have spent decades locating and burning copies of a work known as the Summonitores Libro, a conduit for demonic manifestation.<br><br>Vescari frowned, inserted the disc into the small player, leaned back in his chair, hands folded before him, as the voice began.

    Dermot sat at the same table every day. He rocked his torso and rolled his head aimlessly, humming and hawing in intense conversation that always looked so meaningful, except nobody else was anywhere near him. I couldn’t sit with Dermot again. I had already witnessed two epileptic fits in class, the second of which bloodied my nose as his seizure flung him rigid to the side, his over-sized helmet catching me square in the face as I instinctively turned my body to support him.<br><br>The abruptness and unpredictability of his seizures left an indelible impression, prompting me to reflect, even at the tender age of ten, on the daily fear that must have accompanied Dermot’s existence. Each time I encountered him, my heart carried the weight of guilt, recognising the stark contrast between his world and mine, and the challenges he faced alone.<br><br>Eventually, he left school for a more suitable learning environment, much to everyone’s delight, including the teachers whose collective relief was reflected in their improved attitude toward our raised hands and inane giggling. His empty chair stayed vacant, as if not to tempt some similar eventuality. To me, its image became a cruel epitaph to his time at school. I know I didn’t try hard enough with him. As a kid, I couldn’t describe the feeling I got when glancing at his table. In adulthood, I recognised that feeling to be shame.<br><br>Not by choice, I was permanently seated with Ben in class. A gangly boy with an attitude problem, the kind of kid an adult would describe as having a chip on his shoulder and likely the son of a salesman, given his stingy lunchbox swaps: always two of my things for one of his.<br><br>I shed a lot of puppy fat in Year Five of junior school; my mother’s strawberry compote sandwiches were swapped regularly with carrot and cucumber sticks. Ben, trading beans for cattle, became wide and unwieldy. His neatly cut hair, rosy-red cheeks, and seemingly inexhaustible supply of pristine uniform belied his stupidity.<br><br>I detested every word that came from his mouth, especially when he sensed weakness or unease. Dermot was always easy pickings for Ben, a quick fix when verbally torturing other kids became too challenging for his limited intellect.<br><br>Six months into the school year, still seated with Ben, the headmaster introduced our new teacher, Mrs. Tapscott. The unruly class gradually quietened to total silence as she sat at the piano with her tilted head resting on the palm of her hand, smiling broadly. Mrs. Tapscott never had to ask for silence; her kind eyes and smile encouraged compliance in a way the headmaster’s red-faced bellowing could never achieve in our tension-fraught school assemblies.<br><br>She was a new breed of teacher. Absent were the fire and brimstone hand-waving demands for respect; instead, she adopted teaching principles that gently informed us of our responsibilities, delivered in parabolic tales gathered from every corner of the earth and for every possible indiscretion.<br><br>For the first time in most of our young lives, we were allowed an opinion and to form an interpretation born of our discoveries, not those of our parents. Commonly held working- class principles became malleable and made way for versions of our elders’ stories rooted in love, not fear. Ben, of course, saw no sense in anything she had to say. One winter day in 1991, his wretched mouth would irrevocably alter my future.<br><br>Our return from the half-term holiday came with changes. The tables and teaching apparatus had been moved into a semi-circle, and Dermot’s table had been assimilated somewhere within the new arrangement. Ben’s eyes widened as he closed in on the space next to mine and, with typically irreverent ardour, declared, “Who will be sat at the spastic table?”<br><br>“Spastic” was not a new word to me; my father had referred to me regularly as a spastic while shaking his hands limply from the wrist and moving his eyes upward - usually when I had returned from the shops with something similar to what I had been sent to get but wasn’t quite what was asked for.<br><br>I understood it to mean a person with limited mental capability. I knew how it made me feel, and I knew that Mrs. Tapscott would feel hurt by its use. She turned her head in our direction, looked at me warmly, and smiled.<br><br>The telephone never rang at home - and if it did, someone had died. I expected this call to inform us of the death of my grandfather, who had recently undergone a cataract operation, a minor surgery inflated in importance by the neurosis of my mother.<br><br>My sister and I sat cross-legged in silence as my father pushed on his thick forearms to lift himself out of the armchair and thud toward the telephone. The receiver disappeared in his huge hand, looking as if he were holding just a fist to his ear.<br><br>He answered in the same way he greeted people at the door, on the radio at work, and whenever I looked like I had a question but wasn’t brave enough to disturb his peace. <br><br>“Yeah?” he barked.<br><br>He turned his torso, and the eye that I could see was looking up and down at me. I knew that look. I got the same one when I broke the shed door.<br><br>I knew nothing of my father’s history. Nothing about his parents and very little about his surviving brothers and sisters. Our extended family was distant, a select few gathering once yearly at Christmas in awkward silence.<br><br>I remember a girl running over to me at school before the Christmas holidays, announcing that we were cousins. I had never seen her before. After sheepishly approaching my father with questions, I learned that my uncle Tom lived two streets away. Not wanting to push my luck with my father, I quizzed my mother and discovered we had six uncles and aunts living in the same town - all of them with children. It wasn’t until my father’s death 30 years later that I discovered he and his siblings were subject to the tyranny of an alcoholic father; a shared trauma that bound them together as young people, but separated them as adults for fear of discussion about experiences that they all took decades to recover from.<br><br>In adulthood, I understood his demeanour. As a child, he was more frightening to me than any closet-lurking monster could possibly be. Mum had an easy time of it while he was at work; the appearance of his hulking silhouette at our open bedroom door when returning from a late shift - and having received a rundown of recent events in the home - was enough to keep us all in line. My grandmother was a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps. A coordinator for the Dutch resistance, her mooning of German officers as they prepared to enter a church suspected of hiding Jewish children gave the Catholic minister time to move them into the chapel vaults.<br><br>Her capture and imprisonment were celebrated lore in the family, and she delighted in pulling up her skirt to show a .22 calibre bullet wound she received for the trouble. Moved from Herzogenbusch to Ravensbrück in the final days of the war, she met my Scottish grandfather during liberation and moved to England for a shotgun wedding.<br><br>Despite the aggressive and unreasonable behaviour of my grandfather - not to mention her own dramatic expressiveness - it had been her sense of justice that had been the primary influence on her own children. Rumour has it she failed to call an ambulance when my grandfather dropped to the floor, clutching at his chest.<br><br>Father was a senior detective for Surrey Police. A couple of visits to his place of work impressed upon me the need to communicate clearly with him - especially when in the wrong. Hard but fair was the crux of the collective eulogy on his life from peers at his funeral. He never looked more like a policeman than he did looking at me with the phone in his hand. Despite his casual wear, I saw him in his uniform. I knew I was in for some questions but also that I had done nothing wrong - and that he would know I was telling the truth. I couldn’t maintain any lie; my right eyebrow would wobble with the stress.<br><br>“Did he? Hang on a sec,” he said, placing the receiver on his chest as he turned to fully face me.<br><br>“Did you call some kid a spastic?”<br><br>At first, I made no connection between the claim and what had happened at school. I wracked my brain for answers. After an uncomfortable pause, it dawned on me what was happening. I spoke angrily in response.<br><br>“No. That wasn’t me; that was Ben Arness.”<br><br>My father’s face immediately turned into a half-smile, and he placed the receiver back to his ear.<br><br>“He says he didn’t. Looks like he’s telling the truth to me.”<br><br>His responses seemed so abstract; I couldn’t work out what was being discussed. He then looked directly at my sister, his smile broadening.<br><br>“We were looking for a permanent place like that for him anyway. We caught him sucking a door handle when he was five.”<br><br>My sister blurted out a laugh and pushed me to one side. The event referred to, brought up as often as it could remain funny, made me embarrassed.<br><br>“Yeah, that’s fine by me. Okay. Thanks, bye.”<br><br>“What happened?” I asked.<br><br>“You, my son, are going on a little field trip.”
