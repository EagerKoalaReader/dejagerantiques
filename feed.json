His voice was clear and unhurried. “Good afternoon.” “Afternoon, you caught me between . . . things.” “I apologise,” Croker said. “Did you receive the email I sent this morning?” “I saw it come in, I haven't opened it yet.” “Would you mind doing so now?” Daniel rolled his chair back from the desk and reached for the mouse. The computer took a moment to wake. Daniel&hellip;",

Making her way to the front of the crowd, she leaped from her chair to perform a spasmodic jig in front of Rosie and the beast before taking a bow. My father’s face was incredulous, though fear had gripped him enough to not intervene. “Let’s sing a song from the old country” she bellowed joyously. The piano, still intact, became the new focal point in the room as Mrs. Rabasandratana launched into a haunting, operatic vocal and slammed her hands on the keys, creating an unholy din. The sounds were unsettling, with some residents placing&hellip;",

Her carriage reminded me of an encyclopaedia illustration I once saw of Joan of Arc rallying troops; beckoning confrontation. Towering beside her, the worm stood in an S-shape, its cavernous mouth dripping fluids onto the parquet flooring. Its breathing was a slow, rhythmic pulsing. Ripples passed through its pale pink body, each ending in a rush of air that sounded like breath pushed through cold fingers on a winter morning. I could feel my body preparing to flee. My vision narrowed. I could hear my heartbeat, then I wasn’t sure where I was at all. According&hellip;",

An old-fashioned lamp on the driveway had come on, likely on a timer to light the way on short winter days. Rain fell with impossible ferocity, though the windows remained free of droplets. Bushes were dragged in every direction across the shingle, pulling small stones and dried leaves from the ground which became briefly airborne, giving the uprooted flora the form of a living creature. I couldn’t work out if any of it was even happening. I saw Mr Column’s car moving up the shingle path, this time accompanied by a fire truck and a police&hellip;",

Neither his scraggly shoulder-length hair nor his coat were blowing with the wind. By this point, the rain was so heavy that large pools of water had formed in dips in the shingle where cars had driven through. I could see rainwater dropping onto his shoulders as it spilled from the pot, but there appeared to be no impact splash. He stared back and shrugged, as if to suggest I should be doing something I wasn’t. Then he pointed toward the entrance, pushed his index finger against&hellip;",

Mrs. Tapscott kept asking what was wrong, and each time, Rosie glanced at the bearded man, almost as if seeking permission to speak. She’d adjust her sitting position and temporarily stop scanning the room. This pattern repeated itself. I noticed Mrs. Tapscott shooting disapproving looks at the man, who remained absorbed in Rosie. The encounter was unsettling, as if all three were waiting on some unspoken action that never came. Eventually, realising the futility of continuing to read, the bearded man stood and announced there had been enough excitement for the morning. He&hellip;",

Across its surface, written in black marker, were the words: “Summonitores Libro - testimony of Daniel de Jager.” He sat at his desk beneath the frescoed ceiling of the Archivum Secretum, the morning light reduced to a trembling line across his papers.
