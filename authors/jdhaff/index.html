                  <p>Artifex Memoriae Falsae, first recorded in Seville in 1603, is not a gateway text but a distortion instrument. Structured as a theological treatise on experiential memory, it subtly embeds operator sequences capable of reframing emotional memory during recall. When read aloud to individuals in distress, repeated phrasing amplifies susceptibility to suggestion, creating an artificial reinforcement loop consistent with forbidden Tapping patterns. Early ecclesiastical custodians misidentified the text as a corrective pastoral manual before reports of behavioural instability surfaced. By the nineteenth century, clinical reproductions attempted to isolate its mechanisms, unaware that its structure manipulated memory binding rather than healing it. Multiple copies were destroyed after confirmed cases of induced paranoia.</p>

                  <p>Unlike summoning texts designed for barter with fallen angels, the manuscript functions as a key construct, a linguistic sequence intended to permit lawful entry along established consciousness highways. Its early custodians appear to have believed they were refining angelic invocation protocols, though marginal annotations reveal attempts to force visibility without invitation. The original manuscript was quietly secured after irregular phenomena were recorded in Siena in 1490. Later reproductions circulated among private collectors seeking controlled revelation. Most copies were destroyed after misuse resulted in psychological destabilisation of participants. The surviving original remains under strict monitoring for research at the Croker Institute in Dublin, Ireland. Its mechanisms are not currently understood, though&hellip;</p>

Reams and reams of the unreal litter feeds, stifle with frustration our creative thought and, perhaps most concerning, our trust of one another; the last 4 years have been an assault on the senses. AI, whilst having clear benefits in the fields of health, agriculture and technology, has no place in the creative arts. It is an affront to the expressed pain, suffering and joy in the lived experiences that fuel creativity.&nbsp; If an alien race appeared on the horizon tomorrow, we would all feel better if they expressed themselves, as we do, through the arts.

                  <p>Full sermon of D.C.Caller, the man from seventeen seventeen. Relevant to The Oxford Order. Every human life is shaped by memory. Our choices, perceptions, and even our sense of time itself are the fruit of accumulated experience. Memory is a reflection of God’s own nature. Before the first light broke across the heavens, God not only spoke creation into being through His Word but also held within Himself the total memory of what was, what is, and what will be. This divine experiential memory is the foundation of moral authority. God commands not from ignorance or arbitrariness but from infinite knowledge - His own experiential memory. Scripture begins not with&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Summonitores Libro is a medieval occult manuscript first recorded in 1303 AD, though its origin remains uncertain and likely older. Written in Latin, it is believed to facilitate exchanges with fallen entities, functioning as a ritual mechanism rather than a conventional grimoire. The likely original copy surfaced in private collections across Moscow, Ankara, and Duisburg before entering the McDonough Collection in Belfast, its current status is marked for destruction. Across the centuries, derivative copies appeared in Venice (1702), Leipzig (1844), and in fragmented manuscript form in the early twentieth century. Each secondary version demonstrated structural corruption yet retained ritual efficacy. All known derivative copies were located and destroyed by Daniel&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Possibility Mathematics and physics describe how the universe already behaves, not why the rules responsible for that output exist in the first place.&nbsp;When an experiment is run precisely as it was the first time, the result is the same. If the rules governing the universe shifted randomly, cognition itself could not exist. Rules and rule-sets act like boundaries. They decide what can exist, in what state it exists, if it can move, and what outcomes are possible when interacting with other rules. Behind this structure is God the engineer. Consider numbers. What is “one”? What makes it different from “two”? A number only means something because it is named, defined,&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Garrett learned early that straightness was a lie. In the seventies, before the tobacco stains on his fingers had become permanent, before the old skin smell, he sat in a student flat where the curtains were never fully open and argued about the shape of the world with a fellow student. “Nothing’s truly straight,” Simon said, voice flattened by smoke. “You draw, you zoom in, and there are burrs. A laser? Dust and air make it dance.” He traced an imaginary line in the air and bumped it gently with his knuckle. Garrett watched the gesture as if a priest had lifted a wafer. He had laughed because that is&hellip;</p>

Despite Margaret’s attempts to find him a solution, even with all the back-patting and gentle nursing, Percy suspected her of foul play. Evidence did not align with his suspicions; he had never caught her in the act of imperilment, and through various hospital and specialist appointments, he had long since established that he was not on the receiving end of any insidious contriving; a slow-acting poison had been assumed to be&hellip;</p>

Making her way to the front of the crowd, she leaped from her chair to perform a spasmodic jig in front of Rosie and the beast before taking a bow. My father’s face was incredulous, though fear had gripped him enough to not intervene. “Let’s sing a song from the old country” she bellowed joyously. The piano, still intact, became the new focal point in the room as Mrs. Rabasandratana launched into a haunting, operatic vocal and slammed her hands on the keys, creating an unholy din. The sounds were unsettling, with some residents placing&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Rosie looked different. Strong and upright, the slight hunch and awkward gait was gone. Her carriage reminded me of an encyclopaedia illustration I once saw of Joan of Arc rallying troops; beckoning confrontation. Towering beside her, the worm stood in an S-shape, its cavernous mouth dripping fluids onto the parquet flooring. Its breathing was a slow, rhythmic pulsing. Ripples passed through its pale pink body, each ending in a rush of air that sounded like breath pushed through cold fingers on a winter morning. I could feel my body preparing to flee. My vision narrowed. I could hear my heartbeat, then I wasn’t sure where I was at all. According&hellip;</p>

                  <p>At 4 p.m., sandwiches distributed, I found myself staring out of the windows again. An old-fashioned lamp on the driveway had come on, likely on a timer to light the way on short winter days. Rain fell with impossible ferocity, though the windows remained free of droplets. Bushes were dragged in every direction across the shingle, pulling small stones and dried leaves from the ground which became briefly airborne, giving the uprooted flora the form of a living creature. I couldn’t work out if any of it was even happening. I saw Mr Column’s car moving up the shingle path, this time accompanied by a fire truck and a police&hellip;</p>

                  <p>I sharply pulled my hand from the pages. I couldn't be sure what I'd seen or how I had seen it. I had travelled between consciousnesses, seeing through the eyes of people I had never met and at a time I could never have present. Curiosity got the better of me and was about to place my hand down on the page again before I heard a door swing. I watched Mrs. Tapscott stride across the room to the bottle green door. As she went through, I noticed Mrs. Rabasandratana had joined me in the room. She glared at me for several minutes. As much as I tried to avoid&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Mr. Column stood beneath a suspended plant pot, positioned atop the window outside, seemingly impervious to the heavy rain that cascaded around him. Neither his scraggly shoulder-length hair nor his coat were blowing with the wind. By this point, the rain was so heavy that large pools of water had formed in dips in the shingle where cars had driven through. I could see rainwater dropping onto his shoulders as it spilled from the pot, but there appeared to be no impact splash. He stared back and shrugged, as if to suggest I should be doing something I wasn’t. Then he pointed toward the entrance, pushed his index finger against&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Rosie showed no interest in the story, and despite thirty minutes of persistence, her agitation was palpable. Mrs. Tapscott kept asking what was wrong, and each time, Rosie glanced at the bearded man, almost as if seeking permission to speak. She’d adjust her sitting position and temporarily stop scanning the room. This pattern repeated itself. I noticed Mrs. Tapscott shooting disapproving looks at the man, who remained absorbed in Rosie. The encounter was unsettling, as if all three were waiting on some unspoken action that never came. Eventually, realising the futility of continuing to read, the bearded man stood and announced there had been enough excitement for the morning. He&hellip;</p>

                  <p>We were somewhere in rural Surrey. A thick morning mist made visibility poor, and there were several stops to allow deer crossing the road a safe path into the adjacent meadows. Mr. Column, the school caretaker, was driving, with Mrs. Tapscott in the front passenger seat. My father had warned of the potential for travel sickness, giving a detailed description at the school gate of the time I projectile vomited onto the back of his head as we drove toward our static caravan in Great Yarmouth. Before too long, I could feel my stomach churning. Every now and then, Mrs. Tapscott would turn her head around, smile, and ask if&hellip;</p>

                  <p>The Prefect of the Vatican Apostolic Archives, Monsignor Aurelio Vescari, adjusted his spectacles as he examined the padded envelope that had arrived without insignia or return address. The handwriting was English, neat and deliberate. Inside were a folded letter, a stack of photocopied police documents, and a compact disc in a cracked plastic case. Across its surface, written in black marker, were the words: “Summonitores Libro - testimony of Daniel de Jager.” He sat at his desk beneath the frescoed ceiling of the Archivum Secretum, the morning light reduced to a trembling line across his papers. For a long moment, he stared at the CD. Few things arrived unrecorded in&hellip;</p>
